# Banking

This app simulates how a bank works
It allows for the creation of a bank account,
signing in into an existing account,
Depositing and Withdrawing money

The program uses an SQL database to store account information 

The program needs the database to be hosted for it to work

Here is a quick demo as to how the program works
(No forms were submitted as the database is not hosted):
